  Small claims
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you file for small claims.
  
  Before you get started, gather:
  
  1. Attorney and defendant information.
  2. Your claim which clearly states why the defendant is being sued.
  3. The defendant(s) military status. 
  
  When you are finished, you will need to:
  
  1. Submit payment of the filing fee. 
  2. Await further instructions regarding your case.

  Amount you are claiming | Filing Fee 
           ------|----
    $500 or less | (Filing fee: $40)
    $501 - $2000 | (Filing fee: $50)
    $2001 - $5000| (Filing fee: $100) 
    $5001 - $7000| (Filing fee: $150)
    More than $7000 | (Filing fee: $150)   
  
  If you cannot afford to pay your filing fee, you can ask the court to waive it by requesting it here [Fee Waiver](https://www.mass.gov/indigency-waiver-of-court-fees).
    
  If you are a plaintiff, you can use this interview to file a statement of small claim and notice. 
  
  Please note that this interview cannot tell you what you should say to meet the legal basis needed for a judge to rule in your favor. The court can provide information about how to file a claim, but cannot give legal advice.
  
  There is a time limit on filing any claim in court. This is known as the statute of limitations. While there may be exceptions, generally:

  - a claim based on a contract must be filed in court within 6 years,
  - a claim based on a consumer protection law must be filed in court within 4 years, and
  - a claim resulting from negligence or intentional harm must be filed in court within 3 years.

  Most people take about 15 minutes to complete this interview.

  What is the maximum amount for a small claim?  
content:  |

  The base amount you are suing for (including the value of property) must be $7,000 or less. There are two exceptions:
  
  1. If your claim is based on property damage from an automobile accident, the amount of your claim can be more than $7,000.
  
  2. If you are suing for unfair and deceptive practices under Chapter 93A, or under the Security Deposit Statute, the court may award additional damages above the $7,000 limit. The base amount of your claim must still be $7,000 or less.

question: |
  Plaintiff's Claim
subquestion: |
  ${ card_start("What is a Small Claim", color="info", icon="comment") }
  A small claim is a legal process that is less complex than a traditional civil case. Your case will be heard by the Clerk-Magistrate or an Assistant Clerk-Magistrate of the Court -- not by a judge or jury. The Uniform Small Claims Rues govern small claims cases. The procedure for bringing a small claim action can be found in the Massachusetts General Laws: [G.L c. 218, §§ 21-25](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleI/Chapter218/Section21) 
  ${ card_end() }

  Fill in the amount you are suing for and clearly state your claim so the defendant can understand why they are being sued. Provide the date of the event that is the basis of your claim and requests for relief. This provides the Defendant with a breakdown of the amount being claimed and helps the court decide the amount of any award.

  Are you willing to attempt to settle this claim through mediation?
subquestion: | 
  ${ card_start("What is mediation", color="info", icon="comment") }
  Mediation is when all parties in a lawsuit sit down with a neutral person who helps them discuss the case and tries to negotiate a settlement or resolution.
   
  The Plaintiff must notify the court if they desire mediation. The defendant may consent to mediation on the trial date. You do not lose your right to a trial if you go to mediation and it is unsuccessful.

  ${ collapse_template(how_to_pick_court_help_template) }  
  
  A small claim may be filed in one of three different court departments: District Court, Boston Municipal Court or Housing Court.

  You may bring a small claim in a District or Boston Municipal Court where:
  - at least one plaintiff lives, works, or has a place of business or
  - at least one defendant lives, works, or has a place of business or
  - the rental property is located (if you are filing a claim about a landlord-tenant issue).

  You may bring a small claim in a Housing Court where:
  - the rental property is located (if you are filing a claim about a landlord-tenant issue).

      If you know the defendant’s social security number or birth date, you may determine whether they are on active military duty online at the [SCRA Website](https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/home). If you use the SCRA Webste, you are required to provide a copy of your search results to the court (typically, a certificate generated from the SCRA Website). You must attach a copy of those search results to your Military Affidavit facts below. However, if you do not use the SCRA Website, provide specific facts that support your statement as to the military status of the party(ies). You may include facts that you know through your contact or communications with the party(ies). You may also write to the appropriate military service headquarters, listed [here](https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Military-Departments/), to determine the military status of the party(ies). Please attach any written correspondence you receive from the military in support of your statement. If you are unable to determine whether the defendant is on active military duty and the defendant fails to appear, the court may require you to post a bond or may issue other orders to protect the rights of the defendant if they are on active military duty.

question: |
  Review your answers
subquestion: |
  Depending on where you have chosen to file, you may have the option to eFile your forms after you have reviewed them and paid the filing fee.

  If you do not have the option to eFile, print the completed forms. You may bring or mail the completed form, along with the filing fee, to the Clerk-Magistrate's office of the court where you are filing your case. The filing fee can be paid by cash, credit card, or check or money order made payable to the court.

  Once you have filed your claim you will be assigned a hearing date in court. Cases will be heard by the Clerk-Magistrate or an Assistant Clerk-Magistrate of the Court.

  If you will be submitting documents or other exhibits when you come to court, make sure that you bring extra sets to your hearing: one for the Clerk-Magistrate and one for each Defendant.

  As the Plaintiff, you will be required to appear at all scheduled court dates, or the case may be dismissed by the court.

  Once you have filed the case in court, it is your responsibility as the Plaintiff to notify the court if you and the Defendant(s) resolve the case outside of court. You may be required to file a document in writing to officially close or dispose of the case.

  If the Defendant(s) does not come to the hearing, the Clerk-Magistrate may still require you to prove the value of the damages that you have submitted in your claim. You should be prepared to provide evidence on damages any time you are scheduled to be in court.
