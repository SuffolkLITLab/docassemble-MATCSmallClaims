question: |
  File a small claims complaint
subquestion: |
  This will help you fill out the forms to file a small claim by conducting an interview—
  that is, by asking questions in plain language for you to answer. It will not give you 
  legal advice.
  
  More information on the small claims process is available on the [Massachusetts self-help 
  website](https://www.mass.gov/small-claims), where you can watch videos and read about 
  the small claims process. The website has several useful resources, including information 
  to the statues of limitations, the Massachusetts General Laws, and the Massachusetts 
  Rules of Court.

  Tap the {green words} in any screen for a definition or more information.

  % if form_approved_for_email_filing:
  Once you have completed this interview, you will be able to electronically file the 
  completed forms in the proper court.
  % else:
  Once you have completed this interview, you will be able to download and print the 
  completed forms to file in the proper court.

question: |
  Information for the small claims complaint process
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you file a small claims complaint.
  
  Before you get started, gather:
  
  1. Address of anyone you intend to sue.
  2. Why you are suing them.
  3. Military statuses of anyone you intend to sue. 
  
  When you are finished, you will need to:
  
  1. Pay the filing fee. 

  Amount you are claiming | Filing Fee 
           ------|----
    $500 or less | $40
    $501 - $2,000 | $50
    $2,001 - $5,000| $100 
    $5,001 - $7,000| $150
    More than $7,000 | $150   
  
  If you cannot afford to pay your filing fee, you can ask the court to waive it using this interview.
  
  Please note that this interview cannot tell you what you should say to meet the legal basis needed for a judge to rule in your favor. The court can provide information about how to file a claim, but cannot give legal advice.
  
  There is a time limit on filing any claim in court. This is known as the statute of limitations. While there may be exceptions, generally:

  - A claim based on a contract must be filed in court within 6 years,
  - A claim based on a consumer protection law must be filed in court within 4 years, and
  - A claim resulting from negligence or intentional harm must be filed in court within 3 years.

  Most people take about 30 minutes to complete this interview.

  What is the maximum amount for a small claim?  
content:  |

  The base amount you are suing for (including the value of property) must be $7,000 or less. There are two exceptions:
  
  1. If your claim is based on property damage from an automobile accident, the amount of your claim can be more than $7,000.
  
  2. If you are suing for unfair and deceptive practices under Chapter 93A, or under the Security Deposit Statute, the court may award additional damages above the $7,000 limit. The base amount of your claim must still be $7,000 or less.

  Plaintiff's Claim
subquestion: |
  ${ card_start("What is a Small Claim", color="info", icon="comment") }
  A small claim is a legal process that is less complex than a traditional civil case. Your case will be heard by the Clerk-Magistrate or an Assistant Clerk-Magistrate of the Court -- not by a judge or jury. The Uniform Small Claims Rues govern small claims cases. The procedure for bringing a small claim action can be found in the Massachusetts General Laws: [G.L c. 218, §§ 21-25](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleI/Chapter218/Section21) 
  ${ card_end() }

  Fill in the amount you are suing for and clearly state your claim so the defendant can understand why they are being sued. Provide the date of the event that is the basis of your claim and requests for relief. This provides the Defendant with a breakdown of the amount being claimed and helps the court decide the amount of any award.

question: |
  Are you willing to attempt to settle this claim through mediation?
subquestion: | 
  ${ card_start("What is mediation?", color="info", icon="comment") }
  Mediation is when all parties in a lawsuit sit down with a neutral person who helps them discuss the case and tries to negotiate a settlement or resolution.
   
  The Plaintiff must notify the court if they desire mediation. The defendant may consent to mediation on the trial date. You do not lose your right to a trial if you go to mediation and it is unsuccessful.

  - at least one defendant lives, works, or has a place of business or
  - the rental property is located (if you are filing a claim about a landlord-tenant issue).

  You may bring a small claim in a Housing Court where:
  - the rental property is located (if you are filing a claim about a landlord-tenant issue).

      1. If you know the defendant’s Social Security number or birth date, you can check online if they are on active military duty using the [SCRA Website](https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/home). If you use the SCRA Website, you are required to provide a copy of your search results to the court (typically, a certificate generated from the SCRA Website).
      
      
      2. If you don't use the SCRA Website, provide details supporting your claim about the defendant's military status. You can include facts from your contacts or communications with the defendant. You may also write to the appropriate military service headquarters, listed [here](https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Military-Departments/), to determine the military status.
      
      
      In either case, tell us about your search results or correspondences.

  You may qualify for a fee waiver

question: |
  Review your answers
subquestion: |
  Depending on the court in which you filed the claim, you may have the option to file your forms electronically following your review and payment of the filing fee.

  If you are unable to file electronically, please print out the completed forms. You may either drop off or mail the completed forms, along with the filing fee, to the Clerk-Magistrate's office of the court in which you filed the claim. The filing fee may be paid in cash, with a credit card, or by a check or money order made payable to the court.

  Once you have filed your small claim, you will be assigned a hearing date in court. A Clerk-Magistrate or an Assistant Clerk-Magistrate will preside over this hearing.

  If you intend to submit documents or utilize other exhibits, be sure to bring extra copies of these to your court hearing. You should provide one set for the Clerk-Magistrate and one set for each Defendant.

  As the Plaintiff, you will be required to appear at all scheduled court dates. If you do not appear in court as requested, your case may be dismissed.

  It is your responsibility as Plaintiff to notify the court if you later resolve the case outside of court. Should this occur, you may be required to file a notice to officially close your case.

  If the Defendants do not attend the hearing, the Clerk-Magistrate may still require you to prove the value of the damages that you included in your claim. At each scheduled hearing, please be prepared to provide evidence of the damages you incurred.
